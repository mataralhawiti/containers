#   --> Docker Mastery: The Complete Toolset From a Docker Captain <-- #
#      --> https://www.udemy.com/docker-mastery/ <--

# why docker
    - speed
    - reduce the complixity

# Docker Editions
    - docker is no longer just a " container runtime"
    - CE vs EE
    - three majore types of installs 
        - direct -> it means it runs on that supported OS kernel
        - Mac/Win -> suit of tools including GUI/settings. Basiclly what happens in the background is a small
                    virtual machine has to be started by docker to run the containers in.
                    Docker isn't natively supported in MAc/Win10
        - cloud -> AWS/Azure/Google.. comes with different options

# Windows docker options
    - two types, linux container and Windows containers
    - the difference is the binaries are running 
    - in this course, Linux containers
    - on Win 10, uses Hyper-V with tiny linux VM to run Linux containers
    - powerShell native
    - for docker cli complion on powerShell, please check https://github.com/matt9ucci/DockerCompletion

# Check our Docker install and Config
    - containers are the fundamental building block of the docker toolkit
    - cm : docker version
    - cm : docker info
    - mangement commands vs commands (both work)
    - old commands vs new commands (docker run vs docker container run)
    - old command -> docker <command> (option)
    - new management command -> docker <command><sub-command> (option)
  
# Image vs Container
    - image -> is the binaries, libs and source coud that make your application that you want to run
    - container -> is an instance of the image running as process
    - you can have many containers running off the same image 
    - image registry

# run Nginx container 
    - cm : docker container run --publish 80:80 nginx
        1. download image 'nginx' from docker hub
        2. start a new container from that image
        3. open port 80 on the host IP (left port) ** you can use any port **
        4. routes that traffic to the container IP, port 80
        
    - cm : docker container run --publish 80:80 --detach nginx ( <detach> tells docker to run in the background)
    - cm : docker container ls (only shows running containers)
    - cm : docker container ls (only shows all containers)
    - cm : docker container stop <container-id>
    - cm : docker container run --publish 80:80 --detach --name webhost nginx
    - cm : docker container logs webhost
    - cm : docker container top webhost (top processes inside the container)
    - cm : docker container rm -f 3ede76cf686f (-f to force container to stop)
    - cm : docker rm $(docker ps -aq)

# What happens when we run a container 
    - look for the image locally in image cache, doesn't find anything
    - then looks in remote image repo
    - dowlanod the latest version if we do not specify a version
    - creates a new container based on that image
    - gives it a virtual IP on a private network inside docker engine
    - opnes up port on host and fowwards to port in container if we specify those ports
    - starts container by using the commands in the image Dockerfile


# Containers vs Virtual machines
    - containers are just processes inside the host system
    - Limited to what resources they can access
    - Exit when process stops

 # Assignment : Manage Multiple Containers
    - cm : docker container run -d -p 3306:3600 --name mysql -e MYSQL_RANDOM_ROOT_PASSWORD=true mysql
            what --> create container "db" from lastes image of "mysql", and publish it on port 3306, and 
                        get env vatiable MYSQL_RANDOM_PASSWORD

    - cm : docker container logs db
            what --> capture -e value

    - cm : docker container run -d --name webserver -p 8080:80 httpd
            what -> create container "webserver" from lastes image of "httpd", and publish it on port 8080:80

    - cm : docker container ps (old command)

    - cm : docker container run -d --name proxy -p 80:80 nginx

    - cm : docker container rm -f a4e71859540e 88bff017b331  8ef5227cb704
         what -> delete all containers and forec them to stop before deleting

# What's going on in containers
    - cm : docker container top (process list in one container)
    - cm : docker container inspect (details of one container config)
    - cm : docker container stats (perofrmance stats for all containers)

# Getting a shell inside containers
    - cm : docker container run -it (start new container interactively)
    - cm : docker container exec -it (run additional command in exisiting container)

    - cm : docker container run -it --name proxy nginx bash
            what -> start container in interactive mode and start  bash on startup

    - cm : docker container run -it --name ubuntu ubuntu
    - cm : docker container start -ai ubuntu (start an existing container in interactive mode)  
    - cm : docker container exec -it mysql bash (start interactive insidign running container)

# Docker networks : Concepts
    - cm : docker container run -p (expose ports)
    - docker has the comncept of batteries included but removable which basically means the defualts
        are pretty easy and common to use, but you can change those defualts.
    - cm : docker container port <container> (list open ports on your container)

# Docker networks defaults :
    - each container conncted to a private virtual network "bridge"
    - each virtual netwrok routes through NAT firewall on host IP .
        - basically Docker daemon configuring the host IP adresss on its default interface so that the containers get out
          to the internet or to the rest of the network.
    
    - All containers on a virtual network can talk to each other without -P 
    - best practice to create virtul network for each app. for example :-
        - network "my_web_app" for mysql and php/apache containers
        - network "my_api" for mongodb and node.js containers
    - cm : docker container port webhost
    - cm : docker container inspect --format '{{ .NetworkSettings.IPAddress }}' webhost (to get container IP)
           - Notice how container IP is different from host IP

# How Docker networks move packages  in and out :
    - my host is connected to my network
    - assuming it's a physical network
    - we have Ethernet interface on my host machine
    - there's a firewall on that interface that does a lot of stuff, for example, it bloacks all incoming traffic from network
      so by defualt everthing is bloacked.
    - Any traffic coming from my container would be NAT-ed by default.
    - there's a concept called virtual network and by default you'll see network called "bridge" or "Docker0"
    - when you start new container "container_1", the container is attached to the "bridge" network. and that virtual network
      is automatically attahced to our Ethernet interfaceon our host.
    - on any interface on your host, you can't listen on more than one port for Multiple containers.

# Docker networks: CLI management
    - cm : docker network ls (show networks)
    - cm : docker network inspect (inspect a network)
    - cm : docker network create --network (create a network)
    - cm : docker network connect (attache a network to a container)
    - cm : docker network disconnect (deattahce a network from a container)

    - there's a spcial network called "host" when you do (docker network ls) it skips the virtual network of Docker
      and attahce the container directly to the host interface. therte are pros/cons

    - cm : docker network create my_app_nt
    - cm : docker container run -d --name my_nginx --network my_app_nt nginx (create a new container on a speific network)
    - cm : docker network connect 7bedb818377c 7270f26fd7f2 ( attahced a newwork to a container, now our container is attached to 2 networks)
    - cm : docker network connect <network> <container> ( attahced a newwork to a container )
    - cm : docker network disconnect 7bedb818377c 7270f26fd7f2 ( deattach a newwork from a container, now our container is attached to 1 networks only)
